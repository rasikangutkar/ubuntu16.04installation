# ubuntu16.04installation
Installation of Ubuntu 16.04.1 alongside Windows 10 . Specifically for Dell 15 7559 with Nvidia GTX 960M
Errors faced:
1. Infinite splash screen before installing ubunutu
2. Input/Output error 5 while copying files during ubuntu error
3. NMI watchdog error during shutdown
4. No grub menu after updating drivers


Steps taken to install ubuntu on dell 7559 with nvidia gpu

1.Install pen drive linux


2.Download iso of ubuntu 16.04.1


3.Make a partition 60 gb (check this->64410mb)


4.Make the drive in pendrive linux


    a.NOTE: I had the iso on an external hard disk. Insert the hard disk and pendrive in USBs with the same speed to avoid error along the lines of: Input output error while copying files Replace hard disk, place in cool area, speed different or too fast  

  
5. Restart laptop and press F12

6. Keep secure boot disabled

7. Keep in UEFI mode

8. Select the pendrive in the UEFI options

       a.NOTE: Donâ€™t change the port from which the USB was written to a slower or faster port. Causes the error along the lines:     Input output error while copying files Replace hard disk, place in cool area, speed different or too fast


9. Highlght TRY ubuntu and press e

10. After quick splash add acpi=off OR nomodeset I think I did the first one 

11. Ubuntu desktop starts up 

12. Click on install ubuntu

      13. Fill in all requirements

      14.  When asked for third party software ALLOW and CHECK TURN OFF SECURE BOOT

      15. Let the installation complete . IF you get any error like input output error check step 4 and step 8. If none work try making the USB with RUFUS instead of pendrive linux.

16. Installation complete and reboot.

17. If it directly goes to UBUNTU without showing the grub screen

18. In ubuntu go to additional drivers I switched it from the noveau to nvidia

19. After this the while rebooting the grub menu disappeared

20. To fix this boot into UBUNTU ( black screen shows up hold down shift key this is supposed to help)

21. Now open the command prompt 

22. Run sudo gedit /etc/default/grub

23. Make sure the HIDDEN are commented and go to the resolution line with vbiedit

24. This line is commented 

25. To find the resolution of your screen open another terminal and run xdpyinfo  | grep dimensions 1920x1080 for me

26. Uncomment the line in the grub file and replace it with the output dimensions

27. Save and Close

28. Run sudo update-grub

29. Now shutdown and reboot

29. You should have the grub menu present now.

HOPE THIS WORKS


If after installation and you ever get the error:
Unable to unlock dpkg/var/lock another process is using it 
Many sites online will recommend to delete the file and run reconfig dkg -a or something similar
Instead restart and go to your boot menu and make sure the secure boot is not on. If its on turn it off.
Now boot into Ubuntu and run sudo apt-get update should work properly 
and now if it is suggested to you, you may run the dpkg --a config command.
